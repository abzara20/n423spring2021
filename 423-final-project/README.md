### Description

This is a fully working CRUD, where users are able to make accounts, and create, update and delete builds of Pokemon that they create. In addition, users are able to update their own information. This project is a firebase application, where information is saved using a firestore for both their accounts, and the builds that they make. Users, when creating their builds, can give them unique names, make notes of items they would like to give, and possible moves they would like to know, in addition to being able to change the stats of pokemon via their EVs.
