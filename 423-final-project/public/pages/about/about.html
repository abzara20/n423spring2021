      This is an application created as a final project for my NEWM-N 423 class
      for the fall 2021 semester. This is a firebase project that allows the
      user to create an account and make builds for the video game Pokémon,
      where people can search for Pokémon, change their stats, abilities, and
      make notes of items and moves they would want their pokemon to have. users
      would also have their builds stored with an id matching their account so
      that they can see their builds when they login.

      I created this app because of my love of Pokémon. I love to breed, raise
      and train so that I can play against my friends (and win!). However,
      because I have a poor memory, I could never remember how I wanted to raise
      each Pokémon, and what their moveset should be. So, I built this app so I
      could have the information stored somewhere, and I am pretty proud of it.
      I plan to return to this project in the future, and add the ability to
      add/change natures, but that would be a little difficult to do within the
      time constraint.
